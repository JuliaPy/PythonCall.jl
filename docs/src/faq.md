# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Is PythonCall/JuliaCall thread safe?

No.

Some rules if you are writing multithreaded code:
- Only call Python functions from the first thread.
- You probably also need to call `PythonCall.GC.disable()` on the main thread before any
  threaded block of code. Remember to call `PythonCall.GC.enable()` again afterwards.
  (This is because Julia finalizers can be called from any thread.)
- Julia intentionally causes segmentation faults as part of the GC safepoint mechanism.
  If unhandled, these segfaults will result in termination of the process. To enable signal handling,
  set `PYTHON_JULIACALL_HANDLE_SIGNALS=yes` before any calls to import juliacall. This is equivalent
  to starting julia with `julia --handle-signals=yes`, the default behavior in Julia. 
  See discussion [here](https://github.com/cjdoris/PythonCall.jl/issues/219#issuecomment-1605087024) for more information.
- You may still encounter problems.

## Does it work on Apple silicon (ARM, M1, M2, ...)?

Maybe. Your mileage may vary.

In general, PythonCall and JuliaCall are only supported on platforms with
[Tier 1](https://julialang.org/downloads/#supported_platforms) level of support by Julia.
Currently, Apple silicon is Tier 2, so is not supported.

Due to time constraints, issues affecting only unsupported platforms will not be
investigated. It is much more likely to be an issue with Julia itself than PythonCall.

## Issues when Numpy arrays are expected

When a Julia array is passed to Python, it is wrapped as a [`ArrayValue`](#juliacall.ArrayValue).
This type satisfies the Numpy array interface and the buffer protocol, so can be used in
most places where a numpy array is valid.

However, some Python packages have functions which assume the input is an actual Numpy array.
You may see errors such as:
```
AttributeError: Julia: type Array has no field dtype
```

To fix this you can convert the array `x` to a Numpy array as follows
```julia
Py(x).to_numpy()
```

If the array is being mutated, you will need to pass the argument `copy=false`.

## Heap corruption when using PyTorch

On some systems, you may see an error like the following when using `torch` and `juliacall`:
```text
Python(65251,0x104cf8580) malloc: Heap corruption detected, free list is damaged at 0x600001c17280
*** Incorrect guard value: 1903002876
Python(65251,0x104cf8580) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
[1]    65251 abort      ipython
```

A solution is to ensure that `juliacall` is imported before `torch`.

## `ccall requires the compiler` error when importing some Python libraries
On some systems, you may see an error like the following when import e.g. `matplotlib` before `juliacall`:

```
ERROR: `ccall` requires the compilerTraceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/dingraha/projects/pythoncall_import_error/run.py", line 2, in <module>
    from foo import Foo
  File "/home/dingraha/projects/pythoncall_import_error/foo.py", line 4, in <module>
    import juliacall; jl = juliacall.newmodule("FooModule")
  File "/home/dingraha/projects/pythoncall_import_error/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/juliacall/__init__.py", line 218, in <module>
    init()
  File "/home/dingraha/projects/pythoncall_import_error/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/juliacall/__init__.py", line 214, in init
    raise Exception('PythonCall.jl did not start properly')
Exception: PythonCall.jl did not start properly
```

The likely problem is that the "other" Python library (`matplotlib`, whatever) is loading the system `libstdc++.so`, which isn't compatible with the `libstdc++.so` that Julia ships with.
Linux distributions with older `libstdc++` versions seem more likely to suffer from this issue.
The solution is to either:

  * use a Linux distribution with a more recent `libstdc++`
  * import `juliacall` before the other Python library, so that Julia's `libstdc++` is loaded
  * use a Python from a conda environment, which will have a newer `libstdc++` that is compatible with Julia's

## Can I use JuliaCall to run Julia inside applications with embedded Python?

Yes, it may be possible. See an example of how to have Julia running inside the Python that is running inside Blender here https://discourse.julialang.org/t/running-julia-inside-blender-through-vscode-using-pythoncall-juliacall/96838.
