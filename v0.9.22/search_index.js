The rules are tried in turn until one succeeds.\n\nImplementing func\n\nfunc is called as func(S, x::Py) for some S <: T.\n\nIt must return one of:\n\npyconvert_return(ans) where ans is the result of the conversion (and must be an S).\npyconvert_unconverted() if the conversion was not possible (e.g. converting a list to Vector{Int} might fail if some of the list items are not integers).\n\nThe target type S is never a union or the empty type, i.e. it is always a data type or union-all.\n\nPriority\n\nMost rules should have priority PYCONVERT_PRIORITY_NORMAL (the default) which is for any reasonable conversion rule.\n\nUse priority PYCONVERT_PRIORITY_CANONICAL for canonical conversion rules. Immutable objects may be canonically converted to their corresponding Julia type, such as int to Integer. Mutable objects must be converted to a wrapper type, such that the original Python object can be retrieved. For example a list is canonically converted to PyList and not to a Vector. There should not be more than one canonical conversion rule for a given Python type.\n\nOther priorities are reserved for internal use.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"faq/#FAQ-and-Troubleshooting","page":"FAQ & Troubleshooting","title":"FAQ & Troubleshooting","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"faq/#Can-I-use-PythonCall-and-PyCall-together?","page":"FAQ & Troubleshooting","title":"Can I use PythonCall and PyCall together?","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"faq/","page":"FAQ & Troubleshooting","title":"FAQ & Troubleshooting","text":"Yes, you can use both PyCall and PythonCall in the same Julia session.
